Building for Biodiversity Tool
==============================

This tool provides a framework to assess and score buildings for current and potential biodiversity. It is aimed to be used by non-specialists with little/no ecological knowledge, such as building managers. Although the inputs and outputs are simple, the background methodology is based on sound ecological principles. Scores for potential biodiversity value show how the site can be improved for biodiversity if the suggested recommendations are taken up.

The Building for Biodiversity Tool is an easy to use system allowing users to show-case the improvements they have made for biodiversity on their buildings and surrounding areas.

The Building for Biodiversity Tool is currently in development and will be going through a pilot in summer 2013.
